# Resources for lens modeling with _Herculens_

This repository centralizes useful resources related the strong lens modeling package [`Herculens`](https://github.com/austinpeel/herculens).

## Example notebooks

Here is the list of available example notebooks:

- [**Starting guide**: Lens modeling with gradient descent, Fisher analysis and Hamiltonian sampling](notebooks/herculens__Starting_guide.ipynb)
- [Reconstruction of a complex lensed galaxy with wavelets (and analytical profiles)](notebooks/herculens__Complex_source_with_wavelets.ipynb)
- [Detection of a dark satellite as a localized deviation to the smooth lens potential](notebooks/herculens__Subhalo_detection_with_wavelets.ipynb)

New notebooks will be added soon! Moreover please do not hesitate to reach out for suggestions of new examples.
